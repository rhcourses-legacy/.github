# About this Organization

This organization contains repos that are meant for the development of teaching material.
They contain tasks, examples, slides etc. that I use in various courses at the DHBW Mannheim.
As these courses are given in German, so are the repos in this organization.

A summary of the repos in this organization (in German) can be found in a [separate summary repo](https://github.com/rhcourses/summary).
